# Reusable workflow – Remove sec:adept-to-close label when an issue is closed.
#
# Called from application repositories via workflow_call.
# The caller must trigger on `issues: [closed]`.
# Note: for `workflow_call`, the called workflow receives the same event payload as the caller,
# so `context.payload` (aka `github.event`) is populated without needing to "forward" it via inputs.
